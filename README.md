## 🧠 About Me

I'm a senior developer, data engineer, and AI technologist turned founder with a mission: **Make AI accessible, actionable, and human-centered**. After 20+ years in tech, I now spend my time building AI-powered tools, launching SaaS startups, and coaching others into high-tech careers — all under the banner of **NexAI**.

I believe that technology should serve people, not intimidate them. Whether it's a micro SaaS for job seekers or a learning platform for total beginners, I’m all about **practical innovation**.

Want a version with more street appeal or a more minimalistic one? Or links wired up with actual repos? I can remix it however you want.
